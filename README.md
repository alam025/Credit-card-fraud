🧪 Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize class distribution and feature correlations.
Identify patterns in fraud vs. non-fraud transactions.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle imbalanced data using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
Normalize features like Amount and Time.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training:

Train multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Use cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
Evaluation Metrics:

Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC for performance assessment.
Focus on minimizing false negatives.
⚙️ How to Use
Train the Model:


python src/model.py --predict --model_path outputs/model.pkl --data_path data/new_transactions.csv
🌟 Key Features
Anonymized Data Handling: Secure processing of sensitive features.
Imbalanced Data Solutions: Advanced techniques like SMOTE and undersampling.
Multiple Models: Experimentation with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Visualization: Insights into transaction patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
